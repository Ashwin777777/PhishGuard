# PhishGuard
PhishGuard is a Python-based phishing detection tool that analyzes URLs and email content for suspicious activity using rule-based pattern matching and scoring. It scans for phishing keywords (e.g., "urgent," "verify account"), extracts embedded links, and evaluates risks with a weighted scoring system (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH). The tool auto-generates whitelists (`legitimate_domains.txt`) and keyword lists (`suspicious_keywords.txt`) on first run, provides detailed threat reports, and requires only Python 3.6+ with no external dependencies. Ideal for security teams and developers, it offers modular design for customization—like integrating VirusTotal API—and outputs clear risk assessments with actionable indicators. Run it via CLI with `python3 phishguard.py` to inspect URLs or paste email content directly. Contributions welcome for expanding detection rules and features.
